1) You must create the user accounts noted in /home/ansible/userlist.txt and set up the provided public keys for their accounts. 
consultant
supervisor

sudo su - ansible
ansible dbsystems -b -m user -a "name=consultant"
ansible dbsystems -b -m user -a "name=supervisor"

2)Place Key Files in the Correct Location

ansible dbsystems -b -m file -a "path=/home/consultant/.ssh state=directory owner=consultant group=consultant mode=0755"
ansible dbsystems -b -m copy -a "src=/home/ansible/keys/consultant/authorized_keys dest=/home/consultant/.ssh/authorized_keys mode=0600 owner=consultant group=consultant"
ansible dbsystems -b -m file -a "path=/home/supervisor/.ssh state=directory owner=supervisor group=supervisor mode=0755"
ansible dbsystems -b -m copy -a "src=/home/ansible/keys/supervisor/authorized_keys dest=/home/supervisor/.ssh/authorized_keys mode=0600 owner=supervisor group=supervisor"

3)Ensure nginx Is Enabled and Running on All Hosts
ansible all -b -m service -a "name=nginx state=started enabled=yes"
