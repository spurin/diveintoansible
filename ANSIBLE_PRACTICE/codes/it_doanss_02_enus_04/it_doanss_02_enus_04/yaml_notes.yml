# unquoted scalars - a colon followed by a space or new line is not allowed
drive: c:
# no space or new line here so this is allowed
path: c:\temp

# quote (or double quote) hash values to preserve the colon
drive: 'c:'

# with double quotes you can use escape characters
value: "a \n new line and a \t tab for example"

# Ansible uses “{{ var }}” to denote variables so if you have a value after a
# colon that starts with a “{”, YAML will interpret it as a dictionary, thus
# you must quote it properly
value: "{{ var }}"

# if a value begins with a quote, then the entire value must be quoted
value: "{{ variable }}/additional/string/literal"
value: "{{ variable }}\\backslashes\\are\\special\\chars"

# there are some reserved characters that can't be used as the first character
# in an unquoted scalar
# [] {} > | * & ! % # ` @ ,

# for a literal boolean value (like yes or true) as a string use quotes
not_boolean: "yes"
string: "True"

# YAML converts some strings into floating-point numbers so if you need to
# specify something like a version number for example, use quotes if it appears
# to be like a floating-point value
