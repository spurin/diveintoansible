# Variables are merged or flattened by default to the specific host before a
# play is run and Ansible overwrites variables by default, including those that
# are defined for groups/hosts. Order of precedence from lowest to highest is:
all group (since it is parent to all other groups)
parent group
child group
host

# Groups at the same level are merged alphabetically, with the last group merged
# overwriting previous groups. Thus, an x_group will be merged with a y_group
# and y_group variables that match will overwrite the ones in the x_group. Here,
# the result of the merge is that myvar == y.
x_group:
    myvar: x
y_group：
    myvar: y


# Since Ansible version 2.4, you can use the ansible_group_priority groups
# variable to change the merge order for groups of the same level. The larger
# the prority number, the later it is merged, thereby providing it with a higher
# priority. The default for the variable is 1 if not explicitly set. Here, the
# result of the merge is that myvar == x.
x_group:
    myvar: x
    ansible_group_priority: 5
